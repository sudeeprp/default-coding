## Specifiy with Tests
By Specifying before Implementation, we ensure that the team knows 'when it's done'.
Without a specification, we don't know when we are done and we have no business producing it either!

Example:
Requirement: Simulate a throw of dice
Specification 'somewhat': Show a number between 1 and 6
Specified as a test: Show a number between 1 and 6, ensuring that four consecutive throws don't show the same number and the sequence is different every time we start the game.

As you can see in the example, wording the requirement as a specification-test yields direction to the selection of a random-number-generator.

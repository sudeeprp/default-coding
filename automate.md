## Automate
Boring, repetitive tasks are usually the movtivation for automation. Sometimes, by the time we realize that a task is repeating itself, some manual effort is already wasted. More often, complex manual checks creep into the repetition, which become hard to automate.

This habit is about automating, even when we don't know how many times we would repeat something.

Example: A content management system's output is a html 'home-page', putting together several pieces of the company's information. 

A check to see if the content is updated (which is automatable) gets combined with the validation of usability (which is hard-to-automate magic).

This makes the whole thing tough to automate. 

When we start with the premise to make all actions and checks automated (except when it's magic), we are forced to cut complexity and save even initial repetitive efforts.

That's how the goal of automation keeps things simple - so trivial, that a dumb computer can check it :)

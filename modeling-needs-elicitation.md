### Challenge & Question

- Commit to a customer-value and a business-value
- Start with common knowledge
- Can-do and Like-to-do
- Control expectations

> Avoid challenging an individual in the presence of a group!

### Brainstorm with Focus Groups

- Set the focus to target
- Set the deliverable = Content & Level of Acceptance Criteria
- Look outside: Conferences, Competition, Prior-art

### Interface / Acceptance analysis

- Align stakeholders for sign-off
- Absence of alignment = Validate!
